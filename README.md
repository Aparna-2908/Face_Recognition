# Face_Recognition

Implemented a real-time facial recognition system using Python and OpenCV, capturing and processing grayscale face images with Haar Cascade Classifier for detection.
Trained the model using LBPH algorithm, achieving accurate face recognition and integrating error handling for seamless operation in a live video feed.
